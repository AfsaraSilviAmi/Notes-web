       <h2>✔️How to get Started With Tailwind CSS</h2>
       <p>At first we need to go to <b>tailwindcss.com</b> and from their <b>Play CDN copy the script part and paste it in the head</b>. <br> Then, we can install the <b>Tailwind CSS intelliSense extension</b> on our VS code. We need to create a .css file and paste <b>@import "tailwindcss";</b> on it to make the extension to give suggestions.</p>

        <h2>✔️Where to write Tailwind CSS?</h2>
        <p>Tailwind is written as <b>classes</b> inside the elements. <b>No separate CSS file is needed</b> BUT it can be VERY class heavy and harder to work with.</p>
